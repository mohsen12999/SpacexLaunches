- an application for read data from SpaceX API and show in webpage.

## Tech

- Dot Net Core 7

## Requirements

1. Use the [SpaceX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com/) to retrieve the details of all past and upcoming launches. You can use any programming language or framework of your choice, but we recommend using .NET and React.
2. Implement a React application that displays the details of all past and upcoming launches retrieved from the SpaceX API.
3. Add a feature to your React application that allows the user to click on a launch and view the details of that specific launch.
4. Implement an API endpoint using .NET that retrieves the details of a specific launch by its ID.
5. Add a button or link to your React application that, when clicked, calls your API endpoint and displays the details of the selected launch.
6. Implement automated tests to ensure that the API endpoint returns the expected results for valid inputs and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
